# GNU-emacs-config
This repository stores my GNU emacs config. 
While you can copy paste this config I don't recommend it. Rather copy code snippets that you need and configure them yourself. 

I learnt how to write this config through a video series on youtube:

If you don't know how to configure emacs I highly recommend watching this.
