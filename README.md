# GNU-emacs-config
This repository stores my GNU emacs config. 
While you can copy paste this config I don't recommend it. Rather copy code snippets that you need and configure them yourself. 

I learnt how to write this config through a video series on youtube:

About the creator:
I am 22 and studying software engineering with future plans to pursue a computer science degree. Right now I am working a full time job to prepare finacially for this.
I never expect anything for the use of my resources or time but if you feel so inclined please help me out with a donation:
